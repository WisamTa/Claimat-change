                <ul>
                    <li> The environment helps in protecting the ecosystem: Changes affecting the ecosystem put multiple species in the danger of extinction necessitating the need of protecting the environment. Ecosystems are deeply connected to one another.</li>
                    <li>Protecting the environment protects humanity: Pollution is one of the most hazardous factors affecting the environment. It affects the quality of food leading to the ingestion of toxic substances.
                        </li>
                    <li>Humans have a moral obligation to preserve nature and its features: Humans are responsible for taking care of the environment. Protecting the environment would be an act of fulfilling their compulsions.</li>
                    <li>Biodiversity is a significant part of life in the world: Biodiversity not only consists of the animals living of earth but also the forests, grasslands and tundra, which are significant features in maintaining the life-cycle of the eco-system.</li>
                    <li>Forests provide habitats for a variety of species: Almost half of the species live in forests thus destroying the forests would lead to the destruction of the ecosystem at large.</li>
                    <li>The way in which a person protects the environment reflects their personality: Just as the way you treat other people reflects your personality, the way you treat the environment reflects who you actually are. A good person will treat the environment responsibly. So treat the environment well and prove that you indeed have a good personality.</li>
                    <li>The environment is effective in generating successful food chain: The sun provides light for the plants. The plants are food for the animals that are in turn consumed by other animals. Therefore, destroying the environment would destroy the food chain system.</li>
                    <li>Many animals need the environment for survival: As the environment gets destroyed, the more animals in the ecosystem perish. As the environment is degrading, most of the animal species face extinction.</li>
                    <li>Maintaining the environment such as growing of forests stabilizes noise pollution: With the way our ears process sound, the forest actually cuts down much of the noise we hear or makes some sounds so subtle that we barely notice them. Instead, the forest replaces intrusive noises with its own pleasant sounds of birds chirping and leaves softly rustling.</li>
